      1. while working on a professional project we don not merge codes
      from other branches to the main branch local
      2. the codes in the main branch should always go through a review process known
      as pull request
      the pull request is opened in the github . it can be opened by selecting
      two branches: one branch is the features branch and another is the main branch
